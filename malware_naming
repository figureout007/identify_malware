The malware nomenclature at present used by different anti-malware organizastions could be very confusing, however we need to have an idea about how those naming conventions work so that we can
identify a malware when it is flagged in various sandboxes. I strongly urge the readers to read the footnotes which are written after this list to understand a bit more about naming of malware.

TREND MICRO

In the VSAPI (Virus Scan API), trend micro implements the following naming scheme from July 2nd 2018 as per the updated article published on March 2020. The naming conventions that are implmented
by Trend Micro follows the CARO conventions.

Threat Type.Platform.Family.Variant.Other Info

Threat Type represents the type of malware or greyware that is identified. Malware/Greyware with similar behaviour is grouped into families. Letters are used in a sequential order to identify a variant.

MICROSOFT Bitdefender

Microsoft too claims to name the malware according to CARO naming schemes.

Type:Platform/Family.Variant.Suffixes

Type is the threat type that is represented, which is similar to that of Trend Micro. Platform can be different OS platforms/Scripted Languages/Macros/Other File Types. Family and variant are similar 
to what is represented in TREND MICRO. Suffixes provide the same functionality as 'Other Info' in TREND MICRO.

SYMANTEC - BROADCOM

Symantec uses a rather simpler form of naming malware - Threat Type or Platform.Family.Variant.

F-Secure

F-Secure uses similar nomenclature as what SYMANTIC uses - Threat Type or Platform/Family.Variant.

Kaspersky

Kaspersky uses the following naming convention to categorize their malware - [Prefix:]Behaviour.Platform.Name[.Variant]

Note here that behaviour is similar to 'Threat Type'

The list can be quite long with regards to 'how a malware is named', however I will stop here. The bottom line is however the names are arranged there is something common with the way that the naming
system is attempted to be established by different anti-malware organizations. What is common is to segregate different 'Threat Types' (malware/greyware) into families and variants. Anyone who analyses
a malware needs to identify the 'Threat Type' accurately and the family of malware in order to identify the type of malware you are looking for.
