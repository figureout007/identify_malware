Malware Nomenclature

Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) was an organization that was established to study malware in the year 1990. The thought process behind naming malware is to uniquely identify each 
malware variants. The CARO Malware Naming Scheme groups malware into families and according to the similarity in its code with a unique name.

The following is the pattern is followed as a format to identify each malware:-

[<type>://][<platform>/]<family>[.<group>][.<length>].<variant>[<modifiers>][!<comment>]

Though not directly applied, antimalware organizations use similar nomenclature.

An example of this is:-

Trojan.Win32.ARCBOMB.FSB (Trend Micro) is the same trojan as HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic (Kaspersky) and Mal/MalitRar-I (Sophos). 
Though the names are different the malware is still identified as the same malware.
